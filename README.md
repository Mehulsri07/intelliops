# IntelliOps CoE

**Agentic AIOps for automated incident detection, diagnosis & remediation.**

IntelliOps CoE ingests the telemetry your systems already produce, uses machine learning to
collapse alert storms into a handful of meaningful **Situations**, suggests likely root causes,
and — under strict human-in-the-loop governance — executes safe, reversible remediation. Every
outcome feeds back into the model, so the system gets more accurate the longer it runs.

It is built to **augment** your existing observability, CI/CD, and ticketing stack, not replace
it, and it is **open-source-first** to avoid vendor lock-in.

> **Project status: the closed loop runs live, end-to-end, with real remediation and durable
> state.**
> All six services plus a **read-model service** and a **React operator console** run on
> docker-compose — real Prometheus, a breakable demo target, the HITL approval gate working
> across containers, live KPIs, and a one-command scenario reset for repeatable demos.
> **Remediation is real** on an opt-in path: against a local **kind** cluster, approving a fix
> restarts/scales a real pod and a real health check verifies it (`REMEDIATOR_MODE=k8s`;
> `dry_run` stays the safe default). The compliance audit trail, the learning loop's training
> records, the playbook registry, and live runtime state (pending approvals + the detector's
> baseline) are **persisted to Postgres** and survive restarts (`STORE_BACKEND=postgres`).
> Edge auth (`AUTH_MODE=token`), a CI pipeline, and structured logging + `/ready` readiness
> probes are in place. **The console is now real-time**: the read-service pushes over SSE, a
> live **Pipeline** tab animates every incident through the closed loop as it happens, a new
> **Audit** tab makes the audit trail filterable, and the console was repainted to Apple's light
> website palette (see [docs/UI.md](docs/UI.md), [ADR-018](architectural.md#adr-018--real-time-console-read-path-sse)).
> **Detection and RCA got measurably smarter**: a `CORRELATOR_KIND=river|robust|trained` switch
> adds a seasonal robust-z-score detector and a persisted, re-trainable scikit-learn model on top
> of the unchanged `river` default, RCA ranking now learns from real remediation outcomes, and
> every diagnosis carries an on-by-default (template or LLM) explanation — with a reproducible
> benchmark proving the gains and the trade-offs (see [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md),
> [ADR-019](architectural.md#adr-019--pluggable-detectors-the-finetuning-loop-and-llm-assisted-rca)).
> **A real sample system now feeds the pipeline**: **Meridian**, a four-service Deloitte-style
> financial/audit platform with its own client-portal UI, runs alongside IntelliOps in
> `docker compose up`, wired in through additive-only Prometheus scrape jobs, a broadened
> ingestion query, and a shared deploy-context volume — no IntelliOps code changed. Three fault
> scenarios were verified live end-to-end in real Docker, each producing a genuinely different,
> correct diagnosis (`scale-service` / `restart-pod` / `rollback-deploy`); see
> [docs/MERIDIAN.md](docs/MERIDIAN.md) and

## 📖 Understanding this project — start here

New to this repo? Read these two documents first — they are the fastest way to understand what
IntelliOps is and how it works:

| Read this | To understand |
|-----------|---------------|
| **[flow.md](flow.md)** | **How a signal flows through the system** — the one-incident journey, every bus topic and data contract, a function-by-function reference for each of the seven services, and the current status (what's real vs. simulated). |
| **[architectural.md](architectural.md)** | **Why the system is shaped this way** — the layer model and twenty-one ADRs (Architecture Decision Records), each with the context, the decision, the trade-offs, and the alternatives rejected. |

Then, for the team: **[WORKPLAN.md](WORKPLAN.md)** divides the remaining work into four
owned streams with acceptance criteria. The full original design spec is at
[docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-intelliops-coe-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-intelliops-coe-design.md);
later design decisions have their own specs under `docs/superpowers/specs/`.

## Why this exists

Modern cloud-native estates emit more telemetry than any human team can triage.

- Enterprises receive **500–1,200 alerts/day**, the large majority of it noise, not signal
  (Covasant, 2026).
- Downtime costs an average of **~$15,000/minute** — an aggregate **~$600B/year** across the
  Global 2000 (Splunk & Cisco with Oxford Economics, 2026; verified against the primary press
  release).
- SRE/DevOps engineers burn their time on manual log correlation and alert triage instead of
  resolution, which drives on-call burnout and keeps MTTR stuck in the hours-not-minutes range.

IntelliOps attacks that directly: **less noise, faster diagnosis, safe automated fixes, and a
loop that learns.**

### Target outcomes (from the proposal, grounded in cited industry data)

| KPI | Target | Basis |
|-----|--------|-------|
| MTTR reduction | **40–60%** | Most consistently documented range across independent sources (incl. a Forrester-commissioned study). |
| Alert volume reduction | **80–95%** | Correlation/clustering collapses the ~85–95% false-positive load (Covasant, 2026). |
| Low-risk incidents auto-remediated | **30–60%** (phased) | Set conservatively for a first-year rollout. |
| SRE on-call burden | **~30–40%** reduction | Directionally supported by AIOps case studies; treated as a target range. |

```

Six services communicate over an **event bus**; the only synchronous step is the
`action → governance` approval gate, which enforces the human-in-the-loop guarantee in the
call graph itself. Full walkthrough in [flow.md](flow.md); the reasoning behind each choice is
in [architectural.md](architectural.md).

### The two innovations

1. **The loop closes.** Most AIOps setups treat correlation and remediation as two static,
   disconnected systems. Here, every remediation outcome (did it work? did it roll back?) becomes
   training data for the correlation model, so accuracy compounds instead of freezing at
   deployment-day quality.
2. **A governed Center of Excellence, not a point tool.** RBAC, audit, rollback, and a shared
   playbook registry are a single control plane — countering the well-documented point-solution
   anti-pattern in AIOps adoption.

## Quickstart

> **For a full guided demo, see [DEMO.md](docs/DEMO.md)** — a two-act walkthrough of the live loop
> and real kind-cluster remediation.

> Slice 0 is built: the command below brings up Redis and six health-checked service stubs.
> Slice 1 adds `POST /ingest` on ingestion (8001) and a correlation consumer that emits `Situation`s onto the bus.
> Slice 2 adds rca-service (diagnoses Situations → `situations.diagnosed`) and governance-service (audit log, playbook registry, RBAC at 8005).
> Slice 3 adds action-service (8004): HITL-gated, reversible remediation of `situations.diagnosed` → `remediation.outcomes`, with RBAC-enforced approvals.
> Slice 4 adds feedback-service (8006): labels `remediation.outcomes` into a training store that closes the loop (proven self-healing signatures get suppressed), computes metrics at `GET /metrics`, and graduates playbooks hitl→auto on evidence.

```bash
# 1. Bring up the dev stack (Redis bus + the six service stubs)
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up

# 2. Check every service is alive (/health) and ready (/ready — checks bus + DB)
curl localhost:8001/health   # ingestion — liveness
curl localhost:8001/ready    # ingestion — readiness (200 when deps reachable, else 503)
# ... correlation 8002, rca 8003, action 8004, governance 8005, feedback 8006
```

## Run it live (real data, local, free)

Beyond the mock-data quickstart above, the full stack can run against **real** telemetry —
Prometheus actually scraping a demo app, a real anomaly detector, and remediation (dry-run here;
real pod remediation via the kind demo below) — entirely on your machine, at no cost.

1. **Start the stack** (adds `demo-app`, `prometheus`, and `read` to the six core services):

   ```bash
   docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up --build
   ```

2. **Start the frontend in live mode:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # edit .env.local: set VITE_DATA_MODE=live
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

3. **Drive an incident end to end:**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/chaos.sh
   ```

   This breaks the demo app (`POST /break` on the demo app, [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)),
   generates error traffic, and waits for the stack to detect and diagnose it. Detection takes
   **~15–30 seconds** — that's expected: it's a real Prometheus scrape (every 5s) + ingestion
   poll (every 5s) + River needing a few samples to flag an anomaly, not instant. The script then
   prints the open Situation from the read service ([http://localhost:8007/situations](http://localhost:8007/situations))
   and tells you when to switch to the console.

4. **Approve the fix in the UI.** Open the console, find the open Situation, and click **Approve**.
   Once you're done, recover the demo app with `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/fix`.

**Resetting between runs:** `./scripts/reset.sh` (or `./scripts/chaos.sh reset`) gives a clean
slate without `docker compose down` — recovers the demo app, clears the detector's learned
baseline, and empties the read model.

> **Remediation modes:** By default remediation runs in **dry-run** mode (ADR-007): the action
> service logs the steps and a simulated health check reports healthy — no real infrastructure is
> touched, which is what the quickstart above uses. To see **real** remediation, run the kind-cluster
> demo (`REMEDIATOR_MODE=k8s`) — approving a fix restarts/scales a real pod and a real health check
> verifies recovery. See [deploy/k8s/README.md](deploy/k8s/README.md).

> **Simulation controls note:** The `/reset`, `/reset-baseline`, `/break`, and `/fix` endpoints
> are simulation controls, not production endpoints. When this stack is pointed at a real system,
> they must be gated or removed.

## Proving it's real

The console isn't just a status light — every incident it shows drills down into the evidence
behind it. Open a Situation and you get the metric name and value that tripped it, the
correlator's z-score plotted against its learned baseline, the ranked hypotheses with the
evidence each one cites, a (labeled: LLM or offline-template) explanation, a stage timeline, and
the real remediation outcome with the steps that were actually executed — dry-run runs are
labeled as such, never presented as live infrastructure changes. Nothing on that screen is a
placeholder number; if a field has no real value yet, it isn't shown.

Open the new **System view** and you get the same honesty applied to the platform itself: live
correlator baselines per metric, which backends are wired up (store, bus, telemetry source), the
current remediation mode (dry-run vs. real), and a status badge for the LLM explanation provider.
That badge tells you the truth plainly: **the default is the offline template**, not a live
model — RCA ships with no LLM configured out of the box, which is the honest default for a system
that hasn't been given an API key. Turning a real provider on is opt-in, either via the
`INTELLIOPS_LLM_EXPLANATION_*` environment variables on the `rca` service (see
`deploy/docker-compose.yml`) or live from the console's System view itself, which calls RCA's
`POST /config/llm` (and a `/config/llm/test` probe) to swap the running provider with no restart.
The key you enter is never echoed back by the API.

## Roadmap

Delivered in vertical slices mapped to the proposal's phased rollout. Each slice is a working
increment and is approved before it is built.

The five vertical slices (the closed loop) are done; a second wave of **production-credibility**
work builds on top of them.

| Slice | Phase | Outcome | Status |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| 0 | — | Skeleton: contracts, bus, `docker compose up`, health endpoints | ✅ done |
| 1 | Phase 1 | Noise reduction: telemetry in → one `Situation` out | ✅ done |
| 2 | Phase 2 | RCA suggestions + governance audit/RBAC | ✅ done |
| 3 | Phase 3 | HITL-gated reversible remediation, end to end | ✅ done |
| 4 | Phase 4 | Closed feedback loop + metrics + first `auto` playbook | ✅ done |

**Production-credibility work (since the slices):**

| Area | Outcome | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Real remediation | `KubernetesRemediator` + real health checks on a kind cluster (`REMEDIATOR_MODE=k8s`) | ✅ done |
| Persistence | Audit / training / playbook stores + durable approvals & baseline on Postgres (`STORE_BACKEND=postgres`), Alembic migrations | ✅ done |
| Security & CI | Edge auth (`AUTH_MODE=token`, internal calls authenticate) + a CI pipeline on every PR | ✅ done |
| Observability | Structured JSON logging + a `/ready` readiness probe per service | ✅ done |
| Platform | Kafka bus binding, whole-stack Helm deploy, load/chaos testing | 🚧 in review |
| Intelligence | Pluggable detectors (`robust`/`trained`), persisted retrain loop, reliability-weighted + LLM-explained RCA, CI-enforced benchmark | ✅ done |
| Frontend | Real-time console over SSE, a live incident-pipeline view, an audit explorer, Apple-light repaint | ✅ done |
| Sample production system | **Meridian** — a 4-service financial platform + portal UI, wired to the pipeline, verified live | ✅ done |

## Meridian — a real sample system for IntelliOps to operate

Every incident described above used to come from `demo-app`, a one-endpoint toy target. **Meridian**
(`services/meridian/`) is a small but real **Deloitte-style financial/audit reporting platform** —
four backend services (gateway, validation, aggregation, reporting) plus its own client-portal +
ops-panel UI — that runs alongside IntelliOps in the same `docker compose up` and gives it something
genuinely production-shaped to watch.

Meridian is wired into the pipeline through **additive-only** changes: a Prometheus scrape job per
service, the ingestion query broadened to a regex selector in the compose environment only (the
`common/config.py` default stays `cpu_usage`), and a shared volume that finally lets the
`rollback-deploy` playbook see real deploy markers. No IntelliOps service code changed. Three fault
scenarios were run **sequentially** against real Docker and each produced the expected, genuinely
different diagnosis:

| Fault | Service | Diagnosis |
|---|---|---|
| CPU saturation | meridian-aggregation | `scale-service` |
| Error-rate spike (cpu held at baseline) | meridian-validation | `restart-pod` |
| Deploy marker + saturation | meridian-gateway | `rollback-deploy` (outranks saturation) |

Faults must be injected **one at a time** — the correlator groups anomalies by time window, not by
service, so concurrent faults on two services would merge into one incident; the Meridian
Operations panel enforces this with a sequential-injection guard. Full write-up, the demo script,
and honest limits (synthetic data, toggle-based faults, dry-run remediation) in
[docs/MERIDIAN.md](docs/MERIDIAN.md); the design rationale is
[ADR-020](architectural.md#adr-020--meridian-sample-production-system).

## Security, compliance & safety

- **Human-in-the-loop by construction** — automated action is structurally gated on a
  governance decision; the gate fails **closed**.
- **Reversible-only automation** — every playbook carries its own rollback steps, and health is
  verified after every action.
- **Full audit trail** — every decision is recorded immutably, threaded by `correlation_id`.
- **Compliance-aligned** — NIST AI RMF (Govern/Map/Measure/Manage), EU AI Act risk-tiered
  documentation, and DORA's 4-hour major-incident **notification** window. Deployable
  in-region/on-prem for sovereign-cloud needs. Details in
  [architectural.md §5](architectural.md#5-compliance-mapping).

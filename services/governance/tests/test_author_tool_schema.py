"""The submit_runbook schema must agree with the validator that enforces it.

submit_runbook used to declare its playbook parameter as a bare untyped object
with a prose field list, so the model was never shown the closed vocabularies.
Against a live model it guessed hitl_mode="manual" (HitlMode is
auto|hitl|disabled) and invented per-step keys; Playbook.model_validate rejected
every submission and the agent always ended `gave_up` with no proposal.

These tests pin the schema to common/contracts.py so the two cannot drift.

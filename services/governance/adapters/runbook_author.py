"""RunbookAuthor implementations: draft a typed Playbook for a gap.

NullRunbookAuthor is the CI-safe default — no network, always None.

OpenAICompatibleRunbookAuthor talks to any OpenAI-chat-completions-shaped
endpoint via a synchronous httpx.Client and parses the model's content into a
typed Playbook in ONE shot (no tools). It NEVER raises: any failure —
transport, non-200, non-JSON, missing content, content that isn't JSON, or a
Playbook that fails validation (e.g. an out-of-set action) — returns None (no
draft). The closed RemediationStep Literal is what actually rejects unsafe
actions; the prompt only asks nicely.

RunbookAuthorAgent is the tool-calling successor: instead of asking the model
to draft blind, it hands the model read-tools (TOOL_SCHEMAS from
author_tools.py) so it can gather situation/system/history context before
drafting, and ends the loop only when the model calls `submit_runbook`. It
reuses the same HTTP-with-retry machinery (429 backoff, token cap) as
OpenAICompatibleRunbookAuthor via `_post_chat_completion`. It NEVER raises.

"""Author tools: OpenAI function-calling schemas + a toolbox that dispatches
read-tools against first-party stores.

This module is the tool-calling surface for the runbook-author agent (Task 5):
it declares the `tools` array an LLM function-calling loop is given, and
`AuthorToolbox` executes the 5 read tools by name against whatever stores the
caller wires in (constructor injection — duck-typed, no concrete adapter
imports here, so this module never gains a dependency on Postgres/Redis/etc).

Slim-boundary: stdlib + `common.contracts`/`common.interfaces` only. No
network calls, no heavy deps (torch/sentence_transformers/numpy). Every
read-tool branch is individually try/except'd — a store blip (timeout, bad
row, whatever) must never crash the agent loop; it degrades to an
`{"error": "<ExceptionClassName>"}` result the model can reason about (or a
retry loop can act on) and is logged for operators.

`submit_runbook`'s schema lives in TOOL_SCHEMAS (the model needs to see it to
call it) but `AuthorToolbox.dispatch` does NOT execute it — Task 5's
tool-calling loop intercepts that call itself (it needs to validate the draft,
write the AuthorDecision, and return control to governance's proposal flow;
none of that is a "read against a store" and doesn't belong in this toolbox).

`summarize_result` (Task 3) is a separate, unrelated concern living here only
because it needs the same per-tool knowledge of result shapes: it turns a
tool's raw result dict into a compact one-line digest for the activity trace
(never the raw blob). It is pure stdlib and never raises.

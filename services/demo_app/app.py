"""A tiny breakable target that emits Prometheus metrics.

The operator flips /break to simulate an incident (error rate + CPU spike) and
/fix to recover. IntelliOps scrapes these metrics via Prometheus. This is the
'real running app' the live demo observes — nothing here depends on IntelliOps.

demo_app is a single process on prometheus_client's default registry (unlike
Meridian's four services, there's only ever one of these, so no per-service
label or private registry is needed). It exposes the same USE+RED gauge names
as Meridian (Metrics Phase 1) so the quickstart target shows the same rich
metric surface: cpu_usage + request_rate/latency_p50_ms/latency_p99_ms/
memory_usage_mb/saturation/queue_depth/db_pool_in_use/db_pool_max/
disk_usage_percent. /break moves one representative "something's wrong"
cluster (cpu, latency, memory, saturation, queue_depth up); db pool and disk
stay at baseline since demo_app has no db-exhaustion or disk scenario — it's
the minimal one-endpoint target, not a full fault-profile system like
Meridian's services/meridian/common.py.

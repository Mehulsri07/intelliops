"""Shared fault mechanism + service factory for the Meridian sample system.

Meridian is a small Deloitte-style financial-reporting platform (gateway,
validation, aggregation, reporting) whose only purpose is to be a realistic
target for IntelliOps to monitor. Each service exposes /metrics with a
cpu_usage + meridian_error_rate gauge pair (plus the full USE+RED metric set
below), and an /admin/fault endpoint (gated by common.auth.require_token)
that toggles a simulated incident — mirroring services/demo_app/app.py's
/break /fix but generalized to eight fault types and four services.

CRITICAL — THE load-bearing invariant of the fault mechanism (Metrics Phase 1
Task 2): each scenario moves ONLY the metric cluster that incident would
realistically move; every other metric stays at its healthy baseline. If an
incident lit up metrics outside its realistic cluster, the z-score correlator
would see extra anomalous signals and RCA's weighted playbook selection could
misdiagnose the incident (e.g. scale-service, weight 0.6, outranking
restart-pod, weight 0.5, for what is really a pure error-rate problem). The
8 pinned profiles, and which cluster each moves:

  - saturation:         cpu UP, saturation UP, queue_depth UP
  - latency:             latency_p50/p99 UP, queue_depth UP, cpu mildly UP
  - error:               error_rate UP only — cpu and latency stay baseline
  - memory_leak:         memory_usage_mb RAMPS linearly over duration_seconds
  - traffic_surge:       request_rate UP, cpu UP, saturation UP, queue_depth UP
  - dependency_outage:   error_rate UP, latency_p99 UP — cpu stays baseline
  - db_exhaustion:       db_pool_in_use -> db_pool_max, latency UP
  - crash:               service_up 1 -> 0 (the process is down; nothing else moves)
  - unknown_signal:      tls_handshake_failures UP — a metric family NO RCA rule
                         knows, so it reaches the "root cause undetermined"
                         fallback and escalates to a human. This is the only
                         fault that exercises the ESCALATED path end to end.

"error" and "dependency_outage" are the two scenarios that MUST leave cpu at
CPU_HEALTHY: both are request-level failures (a bug in this service / a
downstream dependency down), not a local capacity problem, so cpu must not
also read as anomalous.

"""Post-remediation health check against a real cluster.

Two signals, both required: pod readiness (readyReplicas == desiredReplicas from
the deployment status) AND metric recovery. When a `policy` + `query_value` are
supplied, the metric signal is the per-metric recovery predicate built fresh from
the Situation's firing metrics (see `services.action.verify.build_metric_healthy`);
otherwise it falls back to the injected `metric_healthy` predicate (default
`lambda: True`) exactly as before, for back-compat. Polls both up to a timeout —
a rolling restart plus a scrape cycle aren't instant. Never raises: an error
mid-poll is treated as 'not yet healthy', so an unreachable cluster times out to
False and the caller rolls back (ADR-007)."""

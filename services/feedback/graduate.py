"""Evidence-based playbook graduation policy (ADR-008).

A playbook graduates hitl→auto only after a clean track record: at least
`min_successes` successful remediations and ZERO failures or rollbacks in the
observed window. Conservative by design — automation scope expands on evidence,
not optimism. feedback proposes; governance promotes under RBAC."""

"""Label a RemediationOutcome as a TrainingRecord — the raw material of the loop.

The signature is derived from the situation id (the "sit-" prefix convention
set by RiverCorrelator.correlate), so no frozen contract needs a new field.
`worked` is True only for a clean success (a rollback or failure did not fix it)."""

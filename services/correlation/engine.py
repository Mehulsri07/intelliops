"""Windowed correlation: buffer anomalous events and emit one Situation per window.

The engine scores each event via the correlator; anomalies accumulate in a
rolling time window keyed on event timestamps. When the window's span exceeds
window_seconds (or on an explicit flush), the buffer collapses into a single
Situation. Timestamps come from events, so behavior is deterministic.

The closed loop (Slice 4): a Situation whose signature has a proven
self-healing track record (reliability >= suppress_threshold) is suppressed —
not emitted — because the system has learned that when this fires, it is fixed."""

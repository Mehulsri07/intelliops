    On a continuous stream the consumer's own span-check only fires when a NEW
    anomalous event arrives; once the baseline learns the elevated value, later
    samples score below threshold and no trigger arrives, so a real incident
    could sit buffered indefinitely. This timer closes the window on elapsed
    wall-clock time. flush() is a no-op when the buffer is empty and is
    lock-guarded against the consumer's add().

    A timer-triggered flush can suppress a situation just as the consumer's own
    flush can (closed-loop signatures don't care which code path collapsed the
    window), so this must drain and publish suppressed situations too — otherwise
    a suppression that only ever happens on a timer-flush is silently lost.

    This thread also piggybacks the periodic baseline snapshot. Because the loop
    wakes on the (possibly shorter) situation-flush cadence, the snapshot runs on
    its own elapsed-time schedule tracked with time.monotonic() rather than once
    per wake. The snapshot is best-effort (_snapshot_baseline_once never raises),
    so a persistence hiccup can never crash this flusher.

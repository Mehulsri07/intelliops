"""Robust, seasonal anomaly detection (numpy batch median/MAD over per-bucket windows).

Unlike RiverCorrelator's online mean/variance, this uses the median absolute
deviation (MAD) of a bounded per-(metric, hour-bucket) window. MAD is robust
to outliers already present in the window: a single earlier spike shifts a
mean/variance baseline (desensitizing later detection of a similar spike),
but the median and MAD barely move because at most one of the window's
values is extreme. This is the key advantage over RiverCorrelator's z-score
for metrics that see occasional real spikes.

Seasonality: samples are bucketed by event.ts.hour (mod seasonal_buckets), so
a metric's day/night baseline doesn't get diluted by mixing hours together.

Persistence: snapshot()/load() round-trip the raw windows in-process (used by
CorrelationEngine.reset()). Durable cross-restart persistence is deferred —
see Task 2 brief Step 5 — so a `robust` correlator cold-starts on restart and
re-warms per bucket. This is intentional and not a Task 2 gap.

"""Rank root-cause hypotheses with deterministic rules, and surface a runbook.

Each rule produces a scored RootCauseHypothesis when it fires; the list is
sorted best-first. A low-confidence fallback guarantees a non-empty result so
downstream always has something to act on (see flow.md 5.3).

An optional `reliability_provider` (situation.signature -> float in [0, 1],
e.g. the correlator's learned worked/total track record) can boost a
hypothesis whose suggested runbook has proven reliable for this signature.
Passing None preserves the original rule-only ranking exactly."""

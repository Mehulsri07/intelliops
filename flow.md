# IntelliOps CoE — Flow & Function Reference

This document tracks **how a signal flows through the system** and **what each function does
and why**. Read it alongside:

- [architectural.md](architectural.md) — *why* the system is shaped this way (ADRs).
- [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-intelliops-coe-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-intelliops-coe-design.md) — the full spec.

> **Status (updated 2026-08-18).** The six-service closed loop is **built and running
> end-to-end**, plus three things that came after the original design: a **read-model service**
> (the CQRS read side the dashboard reads from), a **React operator console**, and a **live,
> repeatably-runnable demo stack** on docker-compose. What ran only as a "target design" in the
> first draft now runs live — including remediation itself, which can now drive a real
> Kubernetes cluster behind an opt-in switch (dry-run stays the production-safe default). See
> [§8 Current status & what's next](#8-current-status--whats-next) for exactly what's real, what's
> still simulated, and what's next.
>
> **A sample production system now feeds real faults into this pipeline.** **Meridian**
> (`services/meridian/`) — a four-service financial/audit platform with its own portal UI — runs
> alongside IntelliOps, scraped by the same Prometheus, ingested by the same ingestion service
> (query broadened additively), and diagnosed by the same unmodified RCA rules. See
> [docs/MERIDIAN.md](docs/MERIDIAN.md) and
> [ADR-020](architectural.md#adr-020--meridian-sample-production-system).
>
> **The remediation path gained a rehearsal, a wider-but-still-safe vocabulary, and bounded
> selection intelligence** — all config-switched off by default. Before approval a fix is
> **rehearsed on an isolated namespace clone** ([ADR-023](architectural.md#adr-023--pre-flight-sandbox-rehearsal-before-remediation));
> the typed action `Literal` widened 4→7 Deployment-scoped verbs behind a **destructive-shape
> denylist** ([ADR-024](architectural.md#adr-024--tier-2-remediation-vocabulary--a-destructive-action-denylist));
> the AI can **draft a runbook for a gap that a human approves** ([ADR-025](architectural.md#adr-025--ai-authored-runbooks-propose--approve));
> and selection is **rules-first with an embedding-similarity fallback** over vetted playbooks
> ([ADR-026](architectural.md#adr-026--semantic-runbook-selection-embedding-fallback)) — retrieval,
> not an LLM choosing the fix. See §5.3–5.5 for where each sits in the flow.

## 1. The one-incident journey (happy path)

A single production incident, from raw telemetry to a closed feedback loop:

```
   Prometheus / Loki / OpenTelemetry
            │  (1) scrape / receive
            ▼
   ┌────────────────────┐
   │ ingestion-service  │   normalize → TelemetryEvent, dedup by fingerprint

   └────────────────────┘   ── training data ▶ correlation-service.retrain()   ⟲ LOOP CLOSED

   ── ALSO consuming the situation/outcome stream (the read side): ──
   ┌────────────────────┐
   │ read-service       │   projects situations.detected/diagnosed + remediation.outcomes
   │  (CQRS read model) │   + situations.suppressed into the exact shapes the UI needs
   └────────────────────┘   ── serves ▶ GET /situations · /outcomes · /metrics
            │                ── pushes ▶ GET /stream (SSE: a "changed" nudge on every mutation)
            ▼
   ┌────────────────────┐
   │ React console      │   Overview (live KPIs) · Incidents (HITL approve/reject)
   │  (operator UI)     │   · Pipeline (live incident-journey lanes) · Governance (gates,
   └────────────────────┘   audit, playbook registry) · Audit (filterable audit explorer)
```

**The single synchronous step** is `action-service → governance-service` (step 6). Everything
else is asynchronous over the bus. The gate fails **closed**: no governance approval → no
action. See [ADR-003](architectural.md#adr-003--governance-is-an-active-gate-not-passive-logging).

**The read side (CQRS).** The six services above are the *write* side — they consume, decide,
and emit events. The **read-service** ([ADR-009](architectural.md#adr-009--a-read-model-service-cqrs-for-the-dashboard))
is a separate consumer that projects those events into an in-memory read model and serves the
dashboard over plain `GET` endpoints. It holds no source-of-truth state — the Redis event
streams are the record, and the projection rebuilds from them on restart. The read-model also
**pushes**: `GET /stream` (Server-Sent Events) emits a generic `{"type": "changed"}` nudge on
every projection mutation, so the console re-fetches within about a second of a real change
instead of waiting out a poll interval ([ADR-018](architectural.md#adr-018--real-time-console-read-path-sse)).

## 2. Bus topics (the wiring)

| Topic | Produced by | Consumed by | Payload | Meaning |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `telemetry.raw` | ingestion | correlation | `TelemetryEvent` | a normalized signal |
| `situations.detected` | correlation | rca, **read** | `Situation` (detected) | an alert storm collapsed into one incident |
| `situations.diagnosed` | rca | action, **read** | `DiagnosedSituation` (situation + hypotheses) | incident with likely cause + suggested fix |
| `situations.suppressed` | correlation | **read** | `Situation` (suppressed) | a signature that reliably self-heals — detected, then *not* emitted as an incident (closed-loop suppression, made visible for metrics) |
| `remediation.outcomes` | action | feedback, **read** | `RemediationOutcome` | did the fix work / roll back |
| `audit.events` | all services | governance | `AuditRecord` | append-only trail (fire-and-forget) |

> **Note.** `situations.diagnosed` carries a `DiagnosedSituation` (the `Situation` plus ranked
> `RootCauseHypothesis` list and the suggested runbook id) — additive over the frozen
> `Situation` contract. Governance also handles approvals over REST (`/approvals`), not the bus
> — approvals are request/response, not a stream (see §5.5).

## 3. Shared data contracts (`common/contracts.py`)

These are the nouns every service passes around. Defined once in `common/` so services can't
drift ([ADR-006](architectural.md#adr-006--monorepo-with-a-shared-common-library)).

| Contract | Key fields | Why it exists |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| `TelemetryEvent` | `source, kind, name, value/payload, labels, ts, fingerprint` | Canonical shape so every downstream service is source-agnostic. |
| `Situation` | `id, status, member_events[], severity, first_seen, last_seen, signature` | The universal incident currency; `signature` recognizes recurrences ([ADR-004](architectural.md#adr-004--situation-as-the-universal-currency)). |
| `RootCauseHypothesis` | `situation_id, description, confidence, evidence[], suggested_runbook_id` | Makes RCA output rankable and actionable, not just prose. |
| `DiagnosedSituation` | `situation, hypotheses[], suggested_runbook_id` | The `situations.diagnosed` payload: a diagnosed `Situation` plus ranked causes. Additive — never mutates the frozen `Situation`. |
| `RemediationStep` | `action, replicas, note` + `cpu_limit, mem_limit, container, revision, probe, …` | The typed unit of a fix. `action` is a **closed `Literal`** of 7 Deployment-scoped verbs — the core safety property: an unlisted action can't validate ([ADR-024](architectural.md#adr-024--tier-2-remediation-vocabulary--a-destructive-action-denylist)). |
| `Playbook` | `id, name, match_rule, steps[], hitl_mode, reversible, rollback_steps[], symptoms` | A remediation with its safety scope and undo baked in ([ADR-007](architectural.md#adr-007--reversible-only-health-verified-remediation)). `symptoms` (added later) is the curated text the semantic selector matches against ([ADR-026](architectural.md#adr-026--semantic-runbook-selection-embedding-fallback)). |
| `PreflightResult` | `passed, detail, mode, sandbox_namespace` | The sandbox rehearsal verdict ([ADR-023](architectural.md#adr-023--pre-flight-sandbox-rehearsal-before-remediation)); rides on `ApprovalRequest` + every `RemediationOutcome`. |
| `ProposedPlaybook` | `id, playbook, status, proposed_by, rationale, source_situation_id, decided_by, ts` | An AI-drafted runbook awaiting human approval ([ADR-025](architectural.md#adr-025--ai-authored-runbooks-propose--approve)); the inner `playbook` validates via the closed action `Literal`. |
| `ApprovalRequest` | `id, situation_id, playbook_id, requested_by, status, decided_by, preflight` | The record a human approves/rejects at the HITL gate; `preflight` (added later) shows the human the rehearsal verdict. |
| `RemediationOutcome` | `situation_id, playbook_id, result, health_after, ts, hitl_mode, steps, mode, preflight` | The feedback signal that closes the loop. `hitl_mode`/`steps`/`mode`/`preflight` (added later) let the read model report auto-vs-HITL, the executed steps, dry-run-vs-k8s, and the sandbox verdict truthfully. |
| `AuditRecord` | `actor, action, resource, decision, ts, correlation_id` | Immutable compliance trail; `correlation_id` threads one incident end to end. |

## 4. Pluggable interfaces (`common/interfaces.py`)

The swap points that keep the system platform-agnostic and testable
([ADR-005](architectural.md#adr-005--pluggable-adapters-behind-interfaces)).

| Interface | Methods | Implementations that exist today | Deferred / planned |
|-----------|---------|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| `TelemetrySource` | `poll()`, `subscribe()` | `FileTelemetrySource` (JSONL, tests), **`PrometheusSource`** (real PromQL over the Prometheus HTTP API, defensive: never raises on a bad response) | Loki, OTel sources |
| `Correlator` | `detect()`, `correlate()`, `retrain()` | `RiverCorrelator` (online z-score, default), **`RobustCorrelator`** (median/MAD + seasonal per-hour baseline), **`TrainedCorrelator`** (composes `RobustCorrelator` + a persisted scikit-learn `IsolationForest`, fitted via `POST /retrain`) — selected by `CORRELATOR_KIND` ([ADR-019](architectural.md#adr-019--pluggable-detectors-the-finetuning-loop-and-llm-assisted-rca)) | — |
| `ExplanationProvider` | `explain()` | `TemplateExplanationProvider` (deterministic, no network — default), **`OpenAICompatibleExplanationProvider`** (real endpoint when `llm_explanation_endpoint` is set; falls back to the template on any error) | — |
| `RunbookSelector` | `select()` | `NullRunbookSelector` (no semantic fallback — default, keyword-rules-only), **`EmbeddingRunbookSelector`** (local `sentence-transformers`, cosine similarity over playbook `symptoms`; ranks only registered playbooks; fail-safe → `None`; `RUNBOOK_SELECTOR_MODE=embedding`, `ml` extra, lazy-imported) ([ADR-026](architectural.md#adr-026--semantic-runbook-selection-embedding-fallback)) | — |
| `RunbookAuthor` | `draft()` | `NullRunbookAuthor` (returns `None` — default), **`OpenAICompatibleRunbookAuthor`** (drafts a typed `Playbook` for a gap via an OpenAI-chat endpoint; fail-to-nothing — any failure or an unsafe/invalid draft → `None`; `RUNBOOK_AUTHOR_MODE=openai`) ([ADR-025](architectural.md#adr-025--ai-authored-runbooks-propose--approve)) | — |
| `Remediator` | `execute()`, `rollback()` | `DryRunRemediator` (logs steps, touches nothing — the safe default), `RecordingRemediator` (tests), **`KubernetesRemediator`** (real `AppsV1Api` calls — restart via a `restartedAt` annotation patch, scale via `patch_namespaced_deployment_scale`, rollback via a rollout-restart annotation; no shell, no string parsing; never deletes; any API error → `False`, never raises. Behind `REMEDIATOR_MODE=k8s`, targeting a local kind cluster — see [deploy/k8s/README.md](deploy/k8s/README.md)) | — |
| `HealthChecker` | `check()` | `AlwaysHealthyChecker` (pairs with dry-run), `FixedHealthChecker` (tests), **real `KubernetesHealthChecker`** (two signals — pod readiness from deployment status, and metric recovery re-queried from Prometheus — polled to a timeout; fails closed. Behind `HEALTH_CHECK_MODE=k8s`) | — |
| `Sandbox` | `rehearse()` | `NullSandbox` (passes through — default, `SANDBOX_MODE=off`), **`NamespaceCloneSandbox`** (clones the target Deployment into a throwaway namespace, applies the same plan, watches the clone recover, tears it down; ranks the fix's *effect* before approval; fail-safe → `PreflightResult(passed=False)`, never raises; `SANDBOX_MODE=k8s`) ([ADR-023](architectural.md#adr-023--pre-flight-sandbox-rehearsal-before-remediation)) | — |
| `GovernanceGate` (action→governance) | `check_rbac()`, `request_approval()`, `await_decision()`, `write_audit()` | `InProcessGovernanceGate` (shared dict, single-process/tests), **`HttpGovernanceGate`** (REST — works across containers; fail-closed on any error) | — |
| `AuditSink` | `write()`, `records()` | `FileAuditSink` (JSONL), `InMemoryAuditSink` (tests), **`PostgresAuditSink`** (hybrid schema — indexed columns + a JSONB payload that is the source of truth; errors propagate, a lost audit write is a compliance failure. Behind `STORE_BACKEND=postgres` — see [docs/PERSISTENCE.md](docs/PERSISTENCE.md)) | — |
| `PlaybookStore` | `register()`, `get()`, `list()` | `InMemoryPlaybookStore` (tests), `FilePlaybookStore` (YAML dir), **`PostgresPlaybookStore`** (upsert via `ON CONFLICT`; same `STORE_BACKEND=postgres` switch) | — |
| `TrainingStore` | `append()`, `read_all()` | `InMemoryTrainingStore` (tests), `FileTrainingStore` (JSONL), **`PostgresTrainingStore`** (same switch; errors propagate) | — |
| `ApprovalStore` | `create()`, `get()`, `decide()`, `list_pending()` | `InMemoryApprovalStore` (file/tests), **`PostgresApprovalStore`** (durable pending HITL approvals; errors propagate like the audit sink — same `STORE_BACKEND=postgres` switch; [ADR-015](architectural.md#adr-015--durable-runtime-state)) | — |
| `BaselineStore` | `save()`, `load_all()` | `InMemoryBaselineStore` (tests), **`PostgresBaselineStore`** (durable z-score baseline; snapshot/reload is **best-effort**, logged and fail-safe — never crashes the flusher or boot; `None` in file mode; [ADR-015](architectural.md#adr-015--durable-runtime-state)) | — |
| `BusClient` | `publish()`, `consume()` | **`RedisBus`** (Redis Streams, consumer groups) | Kafka (prod) |

Tests bind fakes (`RecordingRemediator`, `FixedHealthChecker`, `InMemory*`) to exercise a
service in isolation. **Selection is config-driven** — env switches pick the live vs test-safe
binding (`TELEMETRY_MODE=file|prometheus`, `GOVERNANCE_MODE=in_process|http`,
`STORE_BACKEND=file|postgres`), so the default build stays test-safe and the compose stack turns
the live bindings on.

## 5. Per-service function reference

For each function: **what it does · why we use it · what it depends on.**

### 5.1 `ingestion-service` — get clean, deduped telemetry onto the bus

| Function | What it does | Why | Depends on |
|----------|--------------|-----|-----------|
| `run_poll_loop()` | On an interval, pulls from each configured `TelemetrySource` and hands raw signals to `normalize`. | The service's heartbeat; keeps telemetry flowing without downstream services knowing the source. | `TelemetrySource`, `BusClient` |
| `normalize(raw) → TelemetryEvent` | Converts a vendor-specific signal (Prom sample, Loki line, OTel span) into the canonical `TelemetryEvent`. | So correlation and everything after it are **source-agnostic** — the whole point of the data layer. | `contracts.TelemetryEvent` |
| `compute_fingerprint(event) → str` | Stable hash of the event's identity (name + labels). | Kills duplicate alerts **at the door** — the first, cheapest cut of the 80–95% noise-reduction goal. | — |

### 5.2 `correlation-service` — collapse the storm into a Situation

| Function | What it does | Why | Depends on |
|----------|--------------|-----|-----------|
| `detect_anomaly(event) → score` | Scores an event against the learned baseline; flags the abnormal ones. | The noise-reduction engine — separates signal from the 85–95% false positives. | `Correlator` |
| `correlate(anomalies) → Situation` | Clusters related anomalies (by time / topology / labels) into **one** `Situation`. | Turns an alert storm into a single actionable incident — the core value proposition. | `Correlator`, `contracts.Situation` |
| `load_model()` | Loads the current anomaly/correlation model at startup. | Lets the model evolve without code changes. | model store |
| `retrain(training_data)` | Re-fits the model from labeled outcomes produced by `feedback-service`. | **This is where the closed loop lands** — accuracy compounds over time. | training store, `Correlator` |

**The detector itself is pluggable, config-selected by `CORRELATOR_KIND`**
([ADR-019](architectural.md#adr-019--pluggable-detectors-the-finetuning-loop-and-llm-assisted-rca)),
all three subclassing a shared `BaseCorrelator`:

- **`river` (default, unchanged)** — `RiverCorrelator`: per-metric online z-score
  against a running mean/variance, warm-up gated.
- **`robust`** — `RobustCorrelator`: median/MAD ("robust z-score") instead of
  mean/variance, so one early spike no longer desensitizes the baseline, plus a
  **seasonal baseline**: a separate window per `(metric, hour-of-day)` bucket so a
  daily traffic pattern doesn't read as a global outlier. This is the detector
  `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` shows cutting false positives ~7x on a seasonal scenario.
- **`trained`** — `TrainedCorrelator`: composes `robust` for the live online score
  and blends in a scikit-learn `IsolationForest`'s anomaly margin (`max()` of the
  two, so the model can only add sensitivity). The model is **not** fitted
  automatically — `POST /retrain` on correlation-service is the real trigger (boot's
  `retrain()` call only re-aggregates reliability; the feature buffer is empty at
  boot, so nothing would be fit *from*). A fit's result is persisted as a joblib blob
  to a `model_artifacts` table via a `ModelStore` and reloaded on the next boot, so
  each `POST /retrain` improves on the last one and a restart keeps the trained
  model. A cold `trained` correlator (no fit yet) scores identically to `robust`.
  sklearn/joblib are imported lazily — a `river`/`robust` deployment never pays the
  import cost.

### 5.3 `rca-service` — explain the Situation and suggest a fix

| Function | What it does | Why | Depends on |
|----------|--------------|-----|-----------|
| `enrich(situation) → context` | Attaches recent deploys, config/change data, and service topology to the situation. | Context is what makes a root-cause suggestion **credible** instead of a guess. | deploy/config/topology sources |
| `rank_hypotheses(situation, context, reliability_provider=None) → [RootCauseHypothesis]` | Scores and orders likely causes with their supporting evidence; when a `reliability_provider` is passed, a hypothesis whose runbook has a proven track record for this signature gets a bounded confidence boost. | Gives responders a ranked starting point, not a wall of data — and lets learned outcomes feed ranking. | `contracts.RootCauseHypothesis`, `training_store` |
| `select_runbook(hypotheses, situation, store, selector) → (Playbook, score, source)` | **Rules-first, semantic-fallback:** the keyword rules (`surface_runbook`) run first; when none fires, a `RunbookSelector` ranks the **registered** playbooks by embedding similarity of their `symptoms` field and picks the best above a threshold (`source` = rule / semantic / none). | Adds *some* real intelligence to selection — retrieval among vetted playbooks, never an LLM choosing — catching semantically-obvious matches the keyword rules miss ([ADR-026](architectural.md#adr-026--semantic-runbook-selection-embedding-fallback)). Default `off` → rules-only. | governance registry, `RunbookSelector` |
| `explain(hypothesis, context, situation) → str` | Produces human-readable advisory text for the top hypothesis via an `ExplanationProvider` ([ADR-019](architectural.md#adr-019--pluggable-detectors-the-finetuning-loop-and-llm-assisted-rca)) — set on `RootCauseHypothesis.explanation`, **after** ranking, so it can never affect confidence/order/runbook. | Gives an on-call engineer plain-language context, on by default, with zero CI/test network dependency. | `ExplanationProvider`: `TemplateExplanationProvider` (deterministic, no network — used whenever `llm_explanation_endpoint` is unset) or `OpenAICompatibleExplanationProvider` (sync `httpx` POST to `{endpoint}/chat/completions`; any failure falls back to the template) |

### 5.4 `action-service` — do the fix, safely

| Function | What it does | Why | Depends on |
|----------|--------------|-----|-----------|
| `select_playbook(situation) → Playbook` | Matches a diagnosed situation to a remediation via `match_rule`. | Connects "what's wrong" to "what to do." | governance registry |
| `_denylist_reason(playbook) → reason \| None` | **Gate (before the sandbox):** refuses dangerous step *shapes* (unsafe scale-to-zero, implausible limits, defeated probe, indeterminate revision), fail-closed. | Defense-in-depth over the closed action `Literal` — guards allowed verbs' shapes, and AI-authored drafts ([ADR-024](architectural.md#adr-024--tier-2-remediation-vocabulary--a-destructive-action-denylist)). | — |
| `sandbox.rehearse(situation, plan) → PreflightResult` | **Pre-flight (before approval):** clones the target into a throwaway namespace, applies the same plan, watches the clone recover, tears it down. | Try the fix safely first — a failed rehearsal blocks an `auto` playbook and advises a `hitl` human ([ADR-023](architectural.md#adr-023--pre-flight-sandbox-rehearsal-before-remediation)). Fail-safe; `off` by default. | `Sandbox` |
| `request_approval(playbook, situation) → decision` | **Synchronous** call to governance for RBAC + HITL approval — the pre-flight verdict rides on the request. | The structural HITL gate — action can't proceed without a yes ([ADR-003](architectural.md#adr-003--governance-is-an-active-gate-not-passive-logging)). | `governance-service` |
| `execute(playbook)` | Runs the playbook's typed steps through a `Remediator` — now **7** Deployment-scoped verbs (`restart`/`scale`/`rollback_deploy`/`wait`/`patch_resource_limits`/`rollback_to_revision`/`patch_probe`), the `Literal` still closed ([ADR-024](architectural.md#adr-024--tier-2-remediation-vocabulary--a-destructive-action-denylist)). | Performs the actual fix. | `Remediator` |
| `verify_health() → bool` | Checks system health after acting. | Confirms the fix worked before declaring success. | telemetry / health checks |
| `rollback(playbook)` | Runs `rollback_steps` if health verification fails. | Enforces **reversible-only** automation ([ADR-007](architectural.md#adr-007--reversible-only-health-verified-remediation)). | `Remediator` |
| `emit_outcome(...)` | Publishes a `RemediationOutcome` to `remediation.outcomes`. | Feeds the feedback loop. | `BusClient` |

### 5.5 `governance-service` — the control plane

| Function | What it does | Why | Depends on |
|----------|--------------|-----|-----------|
| `check_rbac(actor, action, resource) → allow \| deny` | Decides whether an actor may perform an action. | Every automated action passes here — the enforceable RBAC guarantee. | RBAC policy |
| `create_approval_request() → ApprovalRequest` | Opens a pending approval for a `hitl` playbook. | Materializes the human decision point. | `contracts.ApprovalRequest` |
| `decide(id, approve \| reject)` | REST endpoint (`POST /approvals/{id}/decide`) a human/console calls to approve or reject. | The approval interface the React console's Approve/Reject buttons drive. | — |
| `get_approval(id)` / `list_approvals()` | REST reads (`GET /approvals/{id}`, `GET /approvals`) of the pending queue. | Lets the HTTP gate poll for a decision across containers, and the dashboard show what's pending. | — |
| `write_audit(record)` | Appends an immutable `AuditRecord`. | The compliance backbone (NIST AI RMF / DORA / EU AI Act). | `AuditSink` |
| `register_playbook()` / `list_playbooks()` | Maintains the CoE playbook registry. | Standardization — playbooks are shared, not reinvented per team. | playbook store |
| `propose_playbook(situation) → ProposedPlaybook` | `POST /playbooks/proposed`: calls a `RunbookAuthor` (LLM) to draft a typed runbook for a gap, forces `hitl_mode=HITL` + a server-assigned id, stores it as a **proposal** (not the live registry); 422 if the author declines. | The AI **proposes** a runbook for a gap; `model_validate` rejects any unsafe draft ([ADR-025](architectural.md#adr-025--ai-authored-runbooks-propose--approve)). | `RunbookAuthor`, proposed store |
| `approve_proposed(id)` / `reject_proposed(id)` | `POST /playbooks/proposed/{id}/approve\|reject` — RBAC-gated (reuses `approve`/`reject`), audited. **Approve registers the inner playbook into the live registry**; reject does not. | The human **disposes** — the only path from an AI draft to the live registry ([ADR-025](architectural.md#adr-025--ai-authored-runbooks-propose--approve)). | RBAC, playbook store, `AuditSink` |

### 5.6 `feedback-service` — close the loop and prove the ROI

| Function | What it does | Why | Depends on |
|----------|--------------|-----|-----------|
| `label_outcome(outcome) → TrainingRecord` | Turns a `RemediationOutcome` into a labeled training example (worked / failed / rolled back). | Converts operational results into learning signal — the innovation. | `contracts.RemediationOutcome` |
| `persist(record)` | Writes the labeled record to the training store `correlation-service` reads. | The physical link that closes the loop. | training store |
| `compute_metrics()` | Tracks success/rollback/failure rates and per-signature reliability from outcomes. | Proves remediation quality with real numbers. *(True MTTR/MTTD, which need detection→resolution timestamps, are computed by the read-service — see §5.7.)* | outcome + situation history |

### 5.7 `read-service` — the CQRS read side the dashboard reads from

The one service that sees a situation's whole lifecycle (`first_seen` → outcome `ts`), so it is
where live KPIs are computed truthfully. Holds no source-of-truth state — a rebuildable
projection of the event streams ([ADR-009](architectural.md#adr-009--a-read-model-service-cqrs-for-the-dashboard)).

| Function | What it does | Why | Depends on |
|----------|--------------|-----|-----------|
| `apply_detected/diagnosed/outcome/suppressed(...)` | Folds each event into an in-memory projection keyed by situation id, mapping backend contracts to the exact shapes the React types expect; each call ends by `publish()`-ing a `{"type": "changed"}` nudge to any subscribed SSE clients. | One place owns the read shape, so the UI needs no translation layer. | the four situation/outcome topics |
| `situations(now_ms)` / `outcomes()` | Serve the live incident queue and outcome ticker (`GET /situations`, `GET /outcomes`). Ages out resolved/failed situations past a TTL and caps the total; **active situations are never pruned.** | Keeps the queue legible over long runs without touching the durable event log. | the projection |
| `metrics()` | Computes the 8 dashboard KPIs — noise-reduction, **real MTTR** (mean of `outcome.ts − first_seen` over resolved situations), auto-remediated %, success rate, open/pending counts, suppressed count (`GET /metrics`). | The Overview tiles read this — every number is derived, nothing fabricated. | the projection |
| `subscribe()` / `unsubscribe()` / `publish()` | Backs `GET /stream` (SSE): each connection gets its own bounded `asyncio.Queue`; consumer threads hand off delivery via `loop.call_soon_threadsafe(...)` (the thread-safe bridge onto the uvicorn event loop); a full queue drops the oldest event rather than blocking. | Pushes changes to the console in near-real-time without the projection needing per-event serialization or a new dependency ([ADR-018](architectural.md#adr-018--real-time-console-read-path-sse)). | the projection, the uvicorn event loop |
| `reset()` | Clears the projection (`POST /reset`). Paired with correlation's `POST /reset-baseline` and demo-app's `/fix` (see [`scripts/reset.sh`](../scripts/reset.sh)). | A one-command clean slate for repeatable simulation runs — **a simulation control, not a production endpoint.** | the projection |

## 6. Two worked scenarios

**Scenario A — noise gets collapsed (Phase 1).** A deploy triggers 200 correlated alerts.
`ingestion` normalizes and dedups them; `correlation.detect_anomaly` flags the abnormal ones;
`correlation.correlate` clusters them into **one** `Situation` on `situations.detected`. A
responder sees a single incident instead of 200 pages. *No action is taken* — Phase 1 stops at
noise reduction.

**Scenario B — a full closed loop (Phase 3–4).** The same `Situation` is diagnosed by `rca`
(top hypothesis: a crash-looping pod after the deploy; runbook: restart-pod). `action.select_playbook`
picks `restart-pod` (mode `hitl`, reversible). `action.request_approval` blocks on
`governance`; an on-call engineer POSTs approve to `governance.decide`. `action.execute`
restarts the pod, `verify_health` passes, `emit_outcome` reports `success`. `feedback.label_outcome`
records it; after enough successes, governance graduates `restart-pod` to `auto`
([ADR-008](architectural.md#adr-008--three-hitl-modes-graduating-by-evidence)). On the next
retrain, `correlation` has learned this signature-plus-fix pair.

## 7. Build phasing (delivered)

The functions above were delivered in slices mapped to the proposal's Phase 0–4. **All four
slices are complete** — each is a working vertical.

| Slice | Proposal phase | What runs at the end of it | Status |
|-------|----------------|----------------------------|--------|
| **0** | — | Skeleton: `common/` contracts + interfaces, Redis bus, `docker-compose up`, health endpoints on all six services. | ✅ |
| **1** | Phase 1 | `ingestion → correlation`: real telemetry in, `Situation` out. (Scenario A works.) | ✅ |
| **2** | Phase 2 | `rca-service` enrichment + hypotheses; `governance` audit + RBAC live. | ✅ |
| **3** | Phase 3 | `action-service` runs one `hitl` reversible playbook end to end with approval + rollback. (Scenario B works.) | ✅ |
| **4** | Phase 4 | `feedback-service` closes the loop; metrics; first playbook graduated to `auto`. | ✅ |

**Since the original slices**, three things were added that the first draft didn't design:
the **read-service** (§5.7), the **React operator console**, and a **live, breakable demo
stack** (a demo target app + real Prometheus + a scenario-reset script) so the whole loop can
be driven and re-driven on docker-compose. See §8.

## 8. Current status & what's next

**What's real, live, end-to-end today** (verified on `docker compose up`):
- The full six-service closed loop, plus the read-service and the React console.
- Real Prometheus scraping a breakable demo app; anomalies detected by the online correlator;
  situations diagnosed; the **HITL approval gate working across containers**; a human approves
  in the console; the loop resolves; live KPIs (real MTTR, noise-reduction) populate.
- Repeatable simulations via `scripts/reset.sh` (recover demo, forget detector baseline, empty
  the read model — no docker restart).

**Persistence is real — behind a backend switch.** The audit log, playbook registry, and
training store can be backed by **Postgres** (`STORE_BACKEND=postgres`), which is the compose
default: a `postgres:16-alpine` service, Alembic migrations applied by a one-shot `migrate`
step, and a hybrid schema (indexed columns + a JSONB payload that is the source of truth).
The same switch also makes two pieces of live **runtime state** durable — **pending HITL
approvals** and the correlator's **z-score baseline** — so a restart mid-incident resumes rather
than forgetting (approvals propagate errors like the audit log; the baseline snapshot/reload is
best-effort and fail-safe). `file` stays the default for tests and quick dev without Docker. See
[docs/PERSISTENCE.md](docs/PERSISTENCE.md),
[ADR-014](architectural.md#adr-014--postgres-persistence-with-a-hybrid-schema), and
[ADR-015](architectural.md#adr-015--durable-runtime-state).

**Remediation is real — on an opt-in kind cluster.** Behind `REMEDIATOR_MODE=k8s` /
`HEALTH_CHECK_MODE=k8s`, `action-service` drives a real Kubernetes API: `KubernetesRemediator`
restarts, scales, and rolls back an actual deployment via typed `AppsV1Api` calls (no shell, no
string parsing, never deletes), and `KubernetesHealthChecker` confirms recovery from pod
readiness plus a live Prometheus query, polled to a timeout. "Resolved" in this mode means the
pod was actually restarted. This is a **documented runbook against a local kind cluster** —
[deploy/k8s/README.md](deploy/k8s/README.md) — **not** part of CI; CI/pytest bind fake K8s
clients and never touch a real cluster.

**Dry-run stays the default everywhere else** (compose without the k8s overlay, tests, CI):
`REMEDIATOR_MODE` defaults to `dry_run` — `DryRunRemediator` logs the steps and
`AlwaysHealthyChecker` reports success, so "resolved" means *the fix was logged and simulated*,
no real infrastructure touched ([ADR-007](architectural.md#adr-007--reversible-only-health-verified-remediation)).

**Observability & readiness are wired uniformly.** Every service emits **structured logs**
through the shared app factory (`INTELLIOPS_LOG_FORMAT=text|json`, default `text`; the compose
stack sets `json` — one JSON object per line for aggregation) and exposes two probes: `/health`
(**liveness** — always `200` while the process can answer, checks nothing external) and `/ready`
(**readiness** — actively pings the bus, plus Postgres for the DB-backed services, returning
`200 {ready:true}` or `503 {ready:false, failed:[...]}` naming the down dependency). Compose runs
the `/ready` probe as a per-service healthcheck; a real cluster should map `livenessProbe: /health`
+ `readinessProbe: /ready` ([ADR-016](architectural.md#adr-016--observability--readiness),
[docs/OBSERVABILITY.md](docs/OBSERVABILITY.md)).

**The console is real-time, with a live pipeline view.** The read-service pushes over SSE
(`GET /stream`, a stdlib thread→async pub/sub inside `ReadModel`) so the console re-fetches within
about a second of a backend change, falling back to the previous 5-second poll if the stream can't
be used ([ADR-018](architectural.md#adr-018--real-time-console-read-path-sse)). The console gained
two tabs: **Pipeline**, which animates every open incident through five stage lanes as its status
changes, and **Audit**, a filterable explorer over the audit trail. Overview's fleet health and
sparklines are now derived from real live data rather than falling back to mock values, and the
whole console was repainted to Apple's light website palette. See [docs/UI.md](docs/UI.md).

**Detection and RCA got measurably smarter.** A `CORRELATOR_KIND=river|robust|trained`
switch ([ADR-019](architectural.md#adr-019--pluggable-detectors-the-finetuning-loop-and-llm-assisted-rca))
adds a seasonal robust-z-score detector (`robust`) and a persisted, re-fittable
scikit-learn `IsolationForest` blended on top of it (`trained`) behind the unchanged
`river` default; `POST /retrain` is the real fit trigger (not automatic — the
feature buffer is empty at boot). RCA's `rank_hypotheses` gained an optional
reliability-weighted boost from real remediation outcomes, and every diagnosed
hypothesis now carries an on-by-default advisory explanation (template, or a
configured OpenAI-compatible endpoint with a template fallback on any error) that
never affects ranking or the suggested runbook. A reproducible, seeded benchmark
(`scripts/benchmark.py` → [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md)) measures the
actual gains **and** the actual trade-offs (higher recall but also higher
false-positive rate on `robust`/`trained`) against the `river` baseline, with one
comparison CI-enforced.

**A real sample system now drives the pipeline.** **Meridian** (`services/meridian/`) — four
backend services plus a client-portal/ops-panel UI, built on the same `services.base.create_app`
scaffold — runs alongside IntelliOps in `docker compose up`. It is wired in additively: a
Prometheus scrape job per service, the ingestion query broadened to a regex selector in the
compose environment only (the code default is unchanged), and a shared volume that lets
`rca-service` see Meridian's deploy markers for the first time. Three fault scenarios were run
sequentially against real Docker and each produced the expected, distinct diagnosis —
`scale-service`, `restart-pod`, `rollback-deploy` — through the unmodified detection/RCA/action
path. Faults must be injected one at a time: `correlation-service` groups anomalies by time
window, not by service, so concurrent faults on two Meridian services would merge into a single
Situation — a real constraint, confirmed live, that the Meridian UI enforces with a
sequential-injection guard. See [docs/MERIDIAN.md](docs/MERIDIAN.md) and
[ADR-020](architectural.md#adr-020--meridian-sample-production-system).

**What is still deliberately simulated / deferred:**
- **Auth is a config-switched edge gate** ([ADR-017](architectural.md#adr-017--edge-authentication)).
  Under `AUTH_MODE=token` the console authenticates with a shared bearer token
  (`VITE_AUTH_TOKEN`) and the read/console endpoints **are** gated — there's no public read
  surface. The `/reset`, `/reset-baseline`, `/reset-approvals`, `/break`, and `/fix` endpoints are
  still **simulation controls** (gated under token mode, but must be removed or gated when this
  stack is pointed at a real system). `/reset-baseline` and `/reset-approvals` now clear the
  runtime-state DB tables (`correlation_baseline`, `approvals`) while **preserving** the audit and
  training records.
- **Automated model retraining.** `POST /retrain` fits and persists the `trained`
  correlator's model on demand; nothing schedules or triggers it automatically yet
  (see [ADR-019](architectural.md#adr-019--pluggable-detectors-the-finetuning-loop-and-llm-assisted-rca)).
  `robust`'s per-hour seasonal windows are also in-process only — not yet a durable
  table — so a restart re-warms them from scratch.
- Demo/report polish, per [WORKPLAN.md](WORKPLAN.md).
